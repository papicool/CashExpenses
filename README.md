# CashExpenses

I created this project for automating some tasks I was doing manually when taking care of my personal finances.
This Project will use only at the first time :

- AWS services such as lambda (Python) and S3 to process my financial data
- an external data storage to externalize data storage (TO DEFINE)

At the second time, We can reflect :
- adding an app (with flask) to help upload data to S3
